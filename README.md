Audio with cool coordinated visuals meant for leds

For now, I intend to use JACK Audio Connection Kit to intercept raw sound from an mp3 player, 
before it makes it to the hardware, and do realtime signal analysis on each chunk and display results to an animated 
display.  Essentially, the goal is to make an automatic light show with music.  Eventually, the computer display data 
will be ported to an LED driver.
